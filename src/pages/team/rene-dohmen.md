As owner/founder of Formatics I use my knowledge to deliver Software Projects and Support.

Specialties: Agile, Scrum, Lean, Unix, Linux, Mac OS X, Web application development, iPhone Apps, 
Python and PyGame programming, Network programming, TDD/BDD/CI, XML/JSON, Network agents, Google Maps, 
Google Android, Music recording and performing.

I'm also a bariton and tenor saxophone player with a keen interest in music education. The iMproviser is 
evolving from a tool that I used to practice and guide improvisation techniques into something that is useable 
for other musicians as well.
