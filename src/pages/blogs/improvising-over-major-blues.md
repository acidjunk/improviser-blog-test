iMprovising over a blues is also a good way to practice scales and before you think this will be all over 
blues scales: it isn't. In this blog post I will show you how you can easily solo for 4 -5 choruses over 
a major blues whilst still keeping it interesting for the audience.

### The exercise

I want to share 2 exercises. The first one uses verticals in the first chorus and mixolydian scales in the second 
chorus. The second one shows how to play 5 choruses over Aebersold.

### Exercise 1: Count on the Blues

Based on the chords from Count on the Blues, for Alto / Bariton sax:
